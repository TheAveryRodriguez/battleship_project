Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
# This iteration we looked at the big picture: what is happening? How do we transition from one step to the next? Look at each step as if we were playing the game in real life and replicate the results; make a PB&J sandwich, ingredient by ingredient.

If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
# Take more time to refine the games overall aesthetic. Make it more graphically fun, and give it more personality.

Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
# For a majority of the we broke the the interaction patterns into chunks to approach and asych/ Once we got to iteration 3 we huddled, ping ponged, and broke the project down once again to be able to async. We ended up coming together towards the end to knock it out.

Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
# With a majority of the work being async, feedback was done via slack. I will say (Blake) I did not do as good of a job at feedback as my partner (Edward): his feedback was consistant, constructive, and done at every stopping point. I (Blake) caught myself later on going quiet too often and unfortunately felt like I left my partner hanging in the dark a few times. 
# Feedback was over slack most of the time. Took time everynight to leave updates on where I was at, what code was updated and what the couple next action steps need to be. It worked out really well, we always got together at the beginning of the day and got on the same page.
